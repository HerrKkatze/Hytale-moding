# Mechatronics  | PLC/SCL Integration for Hytale

## About Me
I am a **Mechatronics and Mobile Robotics Engineering student** specializing in industrial automation, embedded control systems, and robotic programming. My expertise includes **PLC programming using SCL (Structured Control Language)**, automation design, sensor integration, and robotic kinematics.

## Vision: Bringing Industrial PLC Logic into Hytale
I aim to implement **PLC-style automaфвtion** inside **Hytale** using **SCL (Structured Control Language)** or similar structured, text-based logic—bringing realistic industrial control, programmable factories, and smart robotic systems into the game’s sandbox environment.
